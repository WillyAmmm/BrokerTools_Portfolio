### 🚀 Overview

**DAT Auto Refresh** is a Chrome/Edge extension built to eliminate manual refresh tasks on the DAT Loadboard.  
It automatically detects when load posts are nearing expiration and triggers API-based refreshes behind the scenes — keeping brokers’ loads visible and current without them having to touch a thing.

### 🧩 Problem

Before this extension, brokers manually refreshed their DAT postings every 15 minutes to stay visible in search results.  
That repetitive task wasted time each day and created inconsistency — if someone got busy or forgot, their posts went stale and visibility tanked.

---

### ⚙️ Solution

The extension monitors the live DAT grid inside the browser and automatically performs refreshes based on post timers.  
It hooks into DAT’s own `queueToRefresh` API (via a local script bridge) and smartly adjusts its schedule so refreshes always happen at the optimal time.

It also features:
- **Smart timing logic** – waits for the longest active timer before refreshing, plus buffer time.  
- **Retry & error recovery** – handles API hiccups gracefully with short retry loops.  
- **Visual status panel** – in the popup, users can toggle Auto Refresh, view next refresh time, and track total refresh count.  
- **Dark mode support** – clean, modern popup UI with a sun/moon toggle that persists your theme.  
- **Silent operation** – can refresh even when the DAT tab is minimized or backgrounded.

### 🔍 How It Works (Under the Hood)

1. **`content.js`** injects an invisible script (`pageBridge.js`) into DAT’s SPA. This script safely captures the authentication token used by DAT’s internal API.  
2. When triggered, the background service worker (`background.js`) tells the content script to call DAT’s `queueToRefresh` endpoint directly, passing active post IDs.  
3. After a successful API response, the extension quietly repaints the grid using Angular’s internal selectors — no page reload needed.  
4. The cycle repeats every ~15 minutes, or sooner if the UI signals posts have aged early.  
5. State (like dark mode, count, delay timers) is synced through `chrome.storage.local`, so everything stays consistent across sessions.

This entire system works *without touching* the user’s credentials, DOM manually, or requiring the DAT tab to stay in focus.

### 🧠 Impact

- **Eliminated** the need for manual loadboard refreshes.  
- **Improved visibility** and posting uptime on DAT, helping maintain top-of-board positioning.  
- **Reduced fatigue** and user errors caused by repetitive refresh habits.  
- **Allowed brokers to keep their boards fresh without being tied to a computer**, ensuring consistent visibility even while multitasking or away from the desk.
