\# BrokerTools Portfolio



I build automation and analytics tools that make brokerages more efficient and less chaotic.  

Everything here started as a real-world problem on the floor — slow quoting, stale load posts, replying to hundreds of carrier emails — and turned into working solutions I coded myself.  



This repo showcases those projects with short summaries, screenshots, and demos, plus deeper breakdowns for anyone who wants to see what’s happening behind the scenes.





\## 🚛 DAT Auto Refresh (BrokerTools)

\*\*Problem:\*\* Brokers manually refreshed DAT Loadboard posts every 15 minutes, wasting time if loads weren't refreshed or tanking visibility.  

\*\*Solution:\*\* Built a Chrome/Edge extension that detects aging posts and auto-refreshes them using DAT’s own API.  

\*\*Impact:\*\* Kept brokers’ loads visible and competitive by automatically refreshing posts before they expired — no more missed trucks due to stale listings.  



Features include:

\- Smart refresh timing  

\- Retry/recovery logic  

\- Clean modern popup with dark mode toggle  

\- Full background operation (even when the DAT tab is hidden)



\*\*Tech:\*\* JavaScript (MV3), Chrome Extensions API, async messaging, HTML/CSS UI
